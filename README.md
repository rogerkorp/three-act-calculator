# three-act-calculator
 A JS website that runs a simple calculation to determine when each point in the three acts should occur based on a given page count.

## Why Make This Project?

In my spare time I like to do creative writing exercises, and one of my favorite tools to use is this excel spreadsheet I created that calculates the location of each point in a story based on a given page count. This works fine, however I wanted to make the tool accessible to anyone who wants to use it themselves in addition to getting some extra front-end development practice in.

## What does this tool need to do?

For this tool to be a replacement for my already existing spreadsheet, it needs to have the following features:

- The ability to input a specific total page count.
- The ability to input a specific "chapter" or "part" count.
- Calcualtes the correct part where an event would ideally take place
- To indicate where in the three acts / what page number a plot point would ideally occur.
- To indicate the page and part number of when an act begins.
- To list the twelve major points.
