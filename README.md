# three-act-calculator
 A JS website that runs a simple calculation to determine when each point in the three acts should occur based on a given page count.

## Why Make This Project?

In my spare time I like to do creative writing exercises, and one of my favorite tools to use is this excel spreadsheet I created that calculates the location of each point in a story based on a given page count. This works fine, however I wanted to make the tool accessible to anyone who wants to use it themselves in addition to getting some extra front-end development practice in.

## What does this website need?

For each of the twelve plot points, the site needs to...

- Display the **name** of the plotpoint
- Display the **page number**
- Display the **part number**
- Display the **act number**

For each act, the site needs to...

- Display the **act number**
- Display the **page number** where the act begins.

For user inputs, the user needs...

- A form to submit the **total page count**
- A form to submit the **number of parts of thier story**

There should also be some way to display the number of pages per part.
